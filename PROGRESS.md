## Harness initialized - 2026-03-28
- Project type: Python CLI / gateway application (`pyproject.toml`, `nanobot gateway`, pytest)
- Features planned: 52
- init.sh generated: yes
- .gitignore updated: already contained harness entries from global init
- Existing work detected: compared nanobot against `/Users/miau/Documents/openclaw`; found openclaw uses low OpenAI verbosity while nanobot hardcodes medium for both OAuth-backed OpenAI providers
- Baseline validation before feature work:
  - `bash ~/.codex/scripts/global-init.sh` failed repo-wide validation because `tests/test_repo_sync_service.py` imports missing module `nanobot.repo_sync.service`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_openai_oauth_provider.py tests/providers/test_providers_init.py` failed before edits because the OAuth test still patches removed `AsyncOpenAI`, and provider lazy exports omitted `OpenAIOAuthProvider`
- Key decisions:
  - Keep the approved feature narrow: change `openai_oauth` default reply verbosity to low and repair only the directly related regression tests
  - Treat `openai_codex` parity as follow-up work unless explicitly requested
  - Use focused `.venv/bin/pytest` verification because the current repo-wide baseline is already red for an unrelated module

## Session update - 2026-03-28
- Implemented concise default for `openai_oauth` by changing provider payload `text.verbosity` from `medium` to `low`
- Restored provider package lazy export coverage by adding `OpenAIOAuthProvider` back to `nanobot.providers.__all__` and `_LAZY_IMPORTS`
- Rewrote `tests/test_openai_oauth_provider.py` to match the current `_request_codex`-based implementation and assert the low-verbosity payload directly
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_openai_oauth_provider.py tests/providers/test_providers_init.py` -> passed (4 tests)
  - `./init.sh` -> exited 0, reported the known unrelated repo-wide pytest baseline failure, and passed CLI health
- Remaining blockers / follow-up:
  - Full repo baseline is still red because `tests/test_repo_sync_service.py` imports missing `nanobot.repo_sync.service`
  - `openai_codex` still defaults to `text.verbosity = "medium"`; parity work is not included in this session
  - Git write operations are blocked in this environment (`fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`), so the required init checkpoint commit and feature commit could not be created from this session

## Harness reboot - 2026-03-29
- Task pivot:
  - Superseded the prior narrow OpenAI OAuth follow-up plan with the new long-running initiative: let `nanobot` orchestrate coding tasks, let `codex` execute code changes, and let each target repo's harness hold long-term task state
- Existing work detected before re-planning:
  - `nanobot` already had orchestration primitives worth reusing: gateway supervision, cron, heartbeat, session management, and background worker patterns
  - The repo still lacks `nanobot.repo_sync.service`, so repo-wide pytest remains red before any coding-task work
- Completed feature this session:
  - Added a new workspace-scoped `nanobot.coding_tasks` module with persistent coding task metadata, append-only run logs, recoverable-state queries, and a `CodexWorkerManager` lifecycle scaffold
  - Wired gateway startup to initialize the coding task runtime and report tracked/recoverable coding-task counts at boot
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/coding_tasks/test_store.py tests/coding_tasks/test_manager.py` -> passed (6 tests)
  - `.venv/bin/python -m compileall nanobot/coding_tasks` -> passed
  - `.venv/bin/python -c "from nanobot.coding_tasks import CodexWorkerManager, CodingTaskStore; print('coding_tasks ok')"` -> passed
- Key decisions:
  - Treat this session's feature as foundation only: durable task state first, real Codex launching and Telegram command routing later
  - Keep verification focused on the new coding-task module until the unrelated repo_sync baseline is repaired
  - Preserve the no-push-by-default execution model in the future task design; this session only stores the policy boundary
- Remaining blockers / follow-up:
  - `nanobot.repo_sync.service` is still missing, so full-repo pytest remains an unrelated baseline blocker
  - Gateway wiring is only at startup/runtime visibility level today; Telegram command routing and real Codex worker launch are not implemented yet
  - The current harness plan now tracks the coding-task initiative from this new foundation feature onward

## Session update - 2026-03-29 (feature #2)
- Completed feature:
  - Wired the active `nanobot gateway` CLI entrypoint to load the coding-task runtime from the workspace and print tracked/recoverable coding-task counts during startup
- Important findings:
  - The user-facing `nanobot gateway` path still lives in `nanobot/cli/commands.py`; the richer `nanobot/app/gateway.py` path exists in the tree but is not the active entrypoint
  - Missing `nanobot.app.prompts`, `nanobot.app.runtime`, and `nanobot.repo_sync.service` affect the dormant `app/gateway.py` branch, but they do not block this completed CLI gateway feature
- Verification:
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/cli/test_commands.py -k "gateway_reports_coding_task_counts or gateway_uses_configured_port_when_cli_flag_is_missing or gateway_cli_port_overrides_configured_port or gateway_uses_workspace_directory_for_cron_store"` -> passed (4 selected tests)
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/coding_tasks/test_store.py tests/coding_tasks/test_manager.py` -> passed (6 tests)
- Key decisions:
  - Treat the CLI gateway entrypoint as the authoritative runtime path for near-term coding-task work
  - Defer repairing the dormant `app/gateway.py` dependency chain until a feature explicitly needs that richer runtime
- Remaining blockers / follow-up:
  - Full-repo pytest is still red because `tests/test_repo_sync_service.py` imports missing `nanobot.repo_sync.service`
  - The next feature should move from startup visibility into user control, most likely by adding CLI creation/listing commands or Telegram command routing for coding tasks
